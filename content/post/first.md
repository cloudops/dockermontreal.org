# Montreal Docker Meetup #1

About the talk:

OMSignal use containerized services and a custom orchestration tool to deploy and update containers on ec2. 

It is a very good example of how docker can be used from the dev machine to the production servers. 

For our first Docker Meetup, Henri Bouvier will expose how and why they use docker at OMSignal. 

FREE (as in beer, literally)! 

Pizza and beer will be provided by Wajam and Spotr !! 

We also have some goodies and swag provided by Docker!!
