### Docker and OpenStack: Like Peanut Butter and Jelly

By <i class="fa fa-user"></i> [Ayrat Khayretdinov](https://twitter.com/archyufa), OpenStack Deployment Engineer at CloudOps. 40 min, English.

Many people would think that containers will replace Virtual Machines. However it is a misconception, similar to that some people would think that Puppet or Chef can replace VMs, while they complement each other. As soon as you build and package your application in a container and are ready to go live, the next logical step would be to push you application to run in the cloud. Whether it be a public cloud (such as cloud.ca, AWS, GCE or Azure) or a private cloud such as (CloudStack or OpenStack), it consists mostly of VMs running at the back, and this will not change soon. In fact, all of this cloud technologies working hard to make containers first class citizens in their environments by building different services and tools for this type of integration.
In this talk we going to cover how OpenStack cloud can create and manage container environments such as Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, and Apache Mesos. As well, how OpenStack can address security, persistent data and networking concerns related to containers. Live demo of how to run an application which runs on Docker Swarm and Kubernetes cluster in an OpenStack environment."
