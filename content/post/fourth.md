Hi guys,
We are back with a big meetup with four quick and cool talks :)  
Food and space will be sponsored by Microsoft.

For this event we will focus on the recently released features and tools around Docker.  
Each talk will be around 15min 

#### First Topic :
Docker Compose + DockerSwarm by <i class="fa fa-user"></i> Brice Argenson [@bargenson](https://twitter.com/bargenson)  

You will discover Compose and Swarm and how it can help you with continuous delivery.

#### Second Topic:
Docker security & best practices by <i class="fa fa-user"></i> Alexandre Gu√©don [@peerprod](https://twitter.com/peerprod)  
After an overview of general host & kernel security, you'll dive into the many facets and layers of Docker container security.

#### Third Topic:
Docker on Azure by  <i class="fa fa-user"></i> Julien Stroheker [@peerprod](https://twitter.com/ju_stroh)  
You will discover the new Azure Container Service (ACS) on Azure.

#### Fourth Topic:
Docker Control plane and Kitematick by Thomas Bomboh  
You will have a quick tour of those new tools that allows you to setup and manage your containers without using the command line.


Also we now have a blog to communicate between events :)
