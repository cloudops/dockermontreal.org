Join us in celebrating the Docker Projectâ€™s 3rd birthday! 

To warmly welcome newcomers into our Docker community, we will provide Docker training to show them how they can build, ship, and run a distributed application with ease thanks to the Docker platform.

Are you an advanced user? We strongly encourage Docker users of all skill levels to attend! We need a network of mentors
who understand the Docker platform to answer any questions that newcomers may have. [Click here](https://community.docker.com/entities/4939/registrations) to sign up as a mentor.

## Agenda: 

* 5:30 - Doors Open 
* 5:45 - Welcome message, presentation of Docker & snacks 
* 6:00 - Training begins 
* 6:00 to 7:30 - Learning Docker with Birthday App 
* 7:30 to 8:30 - Begin working on hands-on labs 
* 8:30 - Cake and socializing

As we get closer to the event, we will share more information including materials on how to prepare for the training.
